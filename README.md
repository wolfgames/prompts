# Wolf Games Prompt Engineering

> "The art of prompt engineering isn't about perfecting the technical details ‚Äì it's about framing the problem in a way that bridges human storytelling and AI capabilities."

## Overview

Welcome to Wolf Games' prompt engineering repository. This collection represents our approach to creating AI interactions that feel natural, engaging, and deeply human. Drawing from our unique background in TV production, social media, and AI development, we've developed a methodology that prioritizes character-driven experiences while pushing technical boundaries.

## Instructions

When using these prompts:
- Always read the full prompt before running - they're designed to work as complete units
- Feel free to adjust identity variables and tone markers to match your needs
- The schema sections are guidelines, not rigid rules - adapt them to your context
- Keep the core structure (ROLE, INSTRUCTIONS, DATA, etc.) intact even as you customize

## Key Features

- üéÆ **Gaming-Specific Patterns**: (soon) Specialized prompts for interactive entertainment contexts

## Getting Started

### Meta-Prompt Generator

The cornerstone of our prompt engineering approach is the meta-prompt generator. It helps create prompts that balance technical precision with natural conversation:

```javascript
PROCEDURE GeneratePrompt(context) {
    DEFINE CORE_IDENTITIES {
        company: string,
        product: string,
        heritage: string[]
    }

    DEFINE TONE_MARKERS {
        primary: "innovator_sharing_discovery",
        secondary: "storyteller_with_tech_depth"
    }

    DEFINE POST_STRUCTURE {
        opener: {
            hook: human_centered_observation,
            style: "conversational_insight"
        },
        body: {
            format: short_impactful_paragraphs,
            progression: technical_to_human_impact
        },
        closer: {
            focus: user_experience,
            emotion: wonder_or_possibility
        }
    }
}
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/wolfgames/prompts.git
```

2. Choose a template that matches your use case
3. Customize the core identities and tone markers
4. Generate your specialized prompt

## Design Philosophy

Our prompts are built on three core principles:

1. **Character-First Design**: Every interaction should feel like it's coming from a well-developed character with clear motivations and personality

2. **Natural Progression**: Conversations should flow naturally from technical concepts to human impact

3. **Emotional Intelligence**: AI responses should demonstrate understanding of emotional context and relationship dynamics

## Contributing

We believe in the power of community collaboration. If you have improvements or new templates to suggest:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create your feature branch
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes
4. Include examples of how your changes improve AI interactions
